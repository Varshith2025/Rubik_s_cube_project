# Rubik's Cube Project
## This Projects Solves Rubik's Cube with four algorithms BFS,DFS,IDDFS,IDA* 
## Based on some ideas like It turns out we can only reach one-twelfth of the total possible permutations from a solved Rubikâ€™s Cube (https://qr.ae/pGztcM for more info).
## Corner Pattern Database and Edge Pattern Database are created as suggested by Korf in his research paper for IDA* solver
